             Polyglot Extensible Compiler Framework (Version 2.7.1)
             ------------------------------------------------------

Overview
--------

This is release 2.7 of the Polyglot extensible compiler framework.
It contains many improvements over previous releases of Polyglot,
including better debugging support in the PPG parser generator,
preservation of Javadoc comments in translated code, improvements to
the pth testing harness, and many bug fixes, especially related to
generics.

More details on the Javadoc-related changes can be found in the file
doc/release-2.7-notes/PolyglotJavadocPreservation.html.

  - testsjl5: test cases for the Polyglot Java5 language extension
  - skel: a skeleton Polyglot extension, useful for creating new
          extensions

Disclaimer
----------

Polyglot is research software.  Over time, some of the interfaces in the
framework may change.  This may require some extensions to be changed to
conform to the new interfaces.  Also, Polyglot is not well-documented; in
particular, some of the Javadoc is missing or out-of-date.  We are working on
writing better documentation.  For future updates, watch this web page:

    http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Projects/polyglot

If you use Polyglot, we'd appreciate your letting us know.  Send comments
and bug reports to polyglot-developers-L@cornell.edu.

Requirements
------------

Polyglot builds on Unix, Mac OS X, and on Windows using the Cygwin
environment.  We recommend that you use JDK 7 or later.  You will
experience problems with versions of the JDK older than 7.  You must ensure
that java and javac are in your path, and that the JAVA_HOME environment
variable is set to the installation directory of the JDK.  Polyglot is compiled
with the Ant build tool (https://ant.apache.org).

Polyglot uses the JFlex scanner generator.  The JFlex jar file is
included in the Polyglot distribution.  Polyglot is distributed under
LGPL, but JFlex is distributed under GPL.  See the JFlex web site

        http://jflex.de

for updates and the source code of JFlex.  The output of JFlex
inherits the copyright of the specification--licensed under
LGPL in Polyglot's case.  It is possible to substitute your own
lexical analysis or to use another lexer generator such as JLex
(http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/JLex/), but this
is not encouraged.

Creating an extension
---------------------

To see how to create your own extensions, see the file doc/Overview.txt.

Running Polyglot
----------------

Polyglot is compiled with the Ant build tool (http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).

1. Go to the root directory of the Polyglot installation (the directory this
README is in).  We'll call this directory $POLYGLOT from now on.

    $ cd $POLYGLOT

2. Run ant to build the shell script bin/jlc.

    $ ant bin

This need only be performed once.

3. Optionally: add $POLYGLOT/bin to your PATH environment variable.

4. You are now ready to try out Polyglot.
To compile a language extension source file, do:

    $ jlc -ext <extname> <source-file>

For example:

    $ jlc -ext jl5 testsjl5/Generics01.jl5

or equivalently:

    $ jlc -extclass polyglot.ext.jl5.ExtensionInfo \
          testsjl5/Generics01.jl5

The latter usage is convenient if the extension is not implemented as
a subpackage in the polyglot source tree.

To compile using the base compiler, just leave out the -ext option:

    $ jlc File.jl

This should produce a file called File.java that is almost identical to
File.jl.

Java 5 and Java 7 language extensions
-------------------------------------

Polyglot supports Java 5 language extensions with a Polyglot compiler
extension, which can be found in the directory
$POLYGLOT/src/polyglot/ext/jl5. This compiler extension currently
suports all of the Java 5 language extensions except for annotations.

To compile a Java 5 source file, invoke the Polyglot compiler with the
jl5 extension:

    $ jlc -extclass polyglot.ext.jl5.ExtensionInfo \
         testsjl5/Generics01.jl5

The script jl5c in the $POLYGLOT/bin directory provides a convenient
way to invoke the jl5 extension.

    $ jl5c testsjl5/Generics01.jl5

By default, jl5c will translate Java 1.5 code to Java 1.5 code. With
the command line option "-removeJava5isms", jl5c will translate Java
1.5 code to Java 1.4. It will, however, translate enumerations using
the class java.lang.Enum as the superclass of enumeration classes. The
command line option "-enumImplClass <fully-qualified-class-name>"
allows the user to specify a different class to use as the superclass
of enumeration classes. See $POLYGLOT/testsjl5/java-src/MyEnum.java
for an example of a suitable class to use as the superclass of
enumeration classes.

Similarly, the script "jl7c" can be used to compile Java 7 programs.

Building Polyglot
-----------------

The source release includes a fully compiled version of Polyglot.
However, you may want to build the base compiler and the installed extensions
yourself. Follow these steps:

1. First, ensure javac is in your path and that you are using JDK 1.5
or later.  Also ensure JFlex.jar is in your classpath or is in the lib
directory.

2. Change to the $POLYGLOT directory.

    $ cd $POLYGLOT

3. Run ant to build the base compiler.

    $ ant

Optionally, create some extensions in the examples directory:

    $ ant coffer pao

Class files will be placed in the $POLYGLOT/classes directory.
You may optionally, do:

    $ ant jar
    $ ant coffer-jar pao-jar

to create jar files in the lib directory for Polyglot and for each extension.

4. Update PATH and CLASSPATH.

Add $POLYGLOT/bin to your PATH environment variable.  Add
$POLYGLOT/classes (or $POLYGLOT/lib/polyglot.jar) and
$POLYGLOT/lib/java_cup.jar to your CLASSPATH.

5. You are now ready create your own extensions to Java.  See
doc/Overview.txt for instructions on building an extension.  See the
instructions earlier in this file for how to use the compiler.

The Polyglot class file parsing code (src/polyglot/types/reflect)
is derived from code written for the BLOAT bytecode optimizer written
by Nathaniel Nystrom, David Whitlock, and Antony Hosking at
Purdue University.  See http://sourceforge.net/projects/javabloat.

The Base64 code (polyglot.util.Base64) is derived from public domain
code by Robert Harder <rob@iharder.net>.  See http://iharder.net/base64.

The JL5 extension was based on the "Polyglot for Java 5" project by Milan
Stanojevic and Todd Millstein
(http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/research/polyglot5.html), with additional input
from Vincent Cavé.
