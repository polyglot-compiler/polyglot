/**
 * The {@code NodeVisitor} represents an implementation of the "Visitor"
 * style of tree traversal. There is a convention among <b>polyglot</b> visitors
 * which states that traversals will <i>lazily reconstruct</i> the tree. That
 * is, the AST is functionally "modified" by creating new nodes on each
 * traversal, but only when necessary-- only when nodes (or their children) are
 * actually changed. Up to three separate calls into the visitor may be invoked
 * for each AST node. {@code override} allows the visitor to redefine the
 * entire traversal for a particular subtree. {@code enter} notifies the
 * visitor that traversal of a particular subtree has begun.
 * {@code leave} informs the visitor that traversal is finishing a
 * particular subtree.
