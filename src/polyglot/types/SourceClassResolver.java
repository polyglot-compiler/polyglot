/**
 * Loads class information from source files, class files, or serialized class
 * information from within class files. An outline of the steps is given below.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>When the polyglot translator looks for a class by the name "foo.bar.Quux"
 * it first searches for that class in any file given on the command line. If
 * the class is found one of these files, then this definition is used and the
 * remainder of the steps are skipped.
 *
 * <li>If none of these files contain the desired class, then the source path is
 * searched next. For example, if the source extension is ".jl" and the source
 * path is "mydir:." then the translator looks for files "mydir/foo/bar/Quux.jl"
 * and "./foo/bar/Quux.jl".
 *
 * <li>Regardless of whether or not a source file is found, the translator
 * searches the classpath (defined as normal through the environment and
 * command-line options to the interpreter) for the desired class.
 *
 * <li>If no source file exists, and no class is found then an error is reported
 * (skipping the rest of the steps below).
 *
 * <li>If a source file is found, but no class, then the source file is parsed.
 * If it contains the desired class definition (which it should) then that
 * definition is used and the remainder of the steps are skipped. (If it does
 * not contain this definition, an error is reported and the remainder of the
 * steps are skipped.
 *
 * <li>If a class is found but no source file, then the class is examined for
 * jlc class type information. If the class contains no class type information
 * (this is the case if the class file was compiled from raw Java source rather
 * than jlc translated output) then this class is used as the desired class
 * definition (skipping all steps below).
 *
 * <li>(class, but no still no source) If the class does contain jlc class type
 * information, then the version number of translator used to translate the
 * source which created the given class file is compared against the version of
 * the current instantiation of the translator. If the versions are compatible,
 * then the jlc class type information is used as the desired definition. If the
 * versions are incompatible (see the documentation in Compiler.java) then an
 * error is reported. In either case, all remaining steps are skipped.
 *
 * <li>If both a suitable source file and class are found then we have a choice.
 * If the class definition does not contain jlc class type information then the
 * source file is parsed as the definition found in this file is used as desired
 * definition and we stop here. If the class does contain jlc class type
 * information, then continue.
 *
 * <li>(source and class with jlc info) Next the last modification date of the
 * source file is compared to the last modification date of the source file used
 * to generate the class file. If the source file is more recent, the it is
 * parsed as used as the desired definition and all remaining steps are skipped.
 *
 * <li>(source and class with jlc info) Next the jlc version of the class and of
 * the current translator are compared (as in 7.). If the versions are
 * incompatible, then we use the definition from the parsed source file. If the
 * versions are compatible, then we use the definition given by the jlc class
 * type information.
 * </ol>
 * Finally, if at any point an error occurs while reading jlc class type
 * information (e.g. if this information exists but is corrupted), then an error
 * is reported.
