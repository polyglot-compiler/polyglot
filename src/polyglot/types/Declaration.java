 * A Declaration is a type object that has declarations and uses. Some instances
 * may be uses of the declaration; these have references to the original
 * declaration. For example, extensions may perform substitutions on the
 * original declaration to produce the type object for a use of the declaration.
 * To make it easy to create distinct uses by copying the original declaration
 * object, copy() will preserve the pointer to the original declaration; it
 * won't update it to point to the copy. A Declaration used as a declaration has
 * a reference to itself.
